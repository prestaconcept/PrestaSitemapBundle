PrestaSitemapBundle is a Symfony XML sitemap generator.


## Overview

A sandbox is available in a dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yann-eugone/presta-sitemap-test-project).

You may also have a look to [Prestaconcept's website sitemap](https://www.prestaconcept.net/sitemap.xml) 
(which is built with this bundle).


## Versions

This bundle is compatible with all Symfony versions since `2.3.0`.

However, like Symfony, we do not provide support for Symfony's version that reached EOL.


## Features

 * Sitemapindex
 * Google images, video, mobile and multilang urls
 * Respect constraints (50k items / 10MB per file)
 * No database required
 * Optional caching (using `DoctrineCacheBundle`)
